# Computer date and time format consists only of numbers, for example: 21.05.2018 16:30
# Humans prefer to see something like this: 21 May 2018 year, 16 hours 30 minutes
# Your task is simple - convert the input date and time from computer format into a "human" format.
# 
# 
# 
# Input:Date and time as a string
# 
# Output:The same date and time, but in a more readable format
# 
# Precondition:
# 0<date<= 31
# 0<month<= 12
# 0<year<= 3000
# 0<hours<24
# 0<minutes<60
# 
#
