// https://js.checkio.org/mission/between-markers/

// You are given a string and two markers (the initial and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions:
// 
// The initial and final markers are always different.If there is no initial marker then the beginning should be considered as the beginning of a string.If there is no final marker then the ending should be considered as the ending of a string.If the initial and final markers are missing then simply return the whole string.If the final marker is standing in front of the initial one then return an empty string.Input:Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.
// 
// Output:A string.
// 
// Precondition:can't be more than one final marker and can't be more than one initial
// 
// 
// END_DESC
